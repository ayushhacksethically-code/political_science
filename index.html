                <div class="answer-section">
                    <p>Comparative Government and Comparative Politics are related but distinct fields of study within political science, differing in their scope, focus, and methodology.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Comparative Government</h3>
                    <p>Comparative Government is the traditional, narrower approach that emerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It focuses primarily on the formal structures, institutions, and constitutional frameworks of government. Its main characteristics include:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Institutional Focus:</span> Examines formal governmental institutions such as legislatures, executives, judiciaries, and constitutional provisions</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Descriptive Approach:</span> Primarily describes and compares the legal-constitutional arrangements of different states</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Limited Scope:</span> Concentrates mainly on Western democratic systems and their formal structures</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Static Analysis:</span> Tends to view institutions as fixed entities rather than dynamic processes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Comparative Politics</h3>
                    <p>Comparative Politics represents a broader, more comprehensive approach that developed after World War II, particularly from the 1950s onwards. Its characteristics include:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Comprehensive Scope:</span> Studies not just governmental institutions but also political processes, behavior, culture, political parties, interest groups, public opinion, and informal structures</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Analytical Approach:</span> Employs scientific methods, theories, and frameworks to explain political phenomena</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Global Coverage:</span> Includes study of developing nations, non-Western systems, and various political regimes beyond democracies</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Dynamic Analysis:</span> Examines political change, development, modernization, and transformation processes</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Interdisciplinary Nature:</span> Draws from sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>In essence,</strong> Comparative Government asks "What are the structures?" while Comparative Politics asks "How and why do political systems function the way they do?" The evolution from Comparative Government to Comparative Politics reflects the discipline's maturation toward a more scientific, inclusive, and explanatory field of study.</p>

                    <h3>Nature of Comparative Politics</h3>
                    <p>Comparative Politics is a systematic study of political systems, processes, institutions, and behavior across different countries and contexts using comparative methods. Its nature can be understood through several key characteristics:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Scientific Approach:</span> It employs rigorous methodologies, hypothesis testing, and theory-building to understand political phenomena scientifically rather than through mere description</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Empirical Foundation:</span> Based on observable facts and data from various political systems rather than abstract philosophical speculation</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Comparative Method:</span> Uses comparison as its central analytical tool to identify similarities, differences, patterns, and causalities across political systems</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Interdisciplinary Character:</span> Integrates insights from sociology, economics, history, anthropology, and psychology to provide comprehensive analysis</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Scope of Comparative Politics</h3>
                    <p>The scope of Comparative Politics is extensive and includes:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Political Institutions:</span> Study of constitutional arrangements, governmental structures, executives, legislatures, judiciaries, and their functioning</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Political Processes:</span> Analysis of elections, political participation, decision-making, policy formulation, and implementation</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Political Behavior:</span> Examination of voting behavior, political culture, public opinion, political socialization, and citizen engagement</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Political Groups:</span> Study of political parties, pressure groups, interest groups, social movements, and civil society organizations</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Political Systems:</span> Comparison of democracies, authoritarian regimes, totalitarian systems, and hybrid regimes</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Political Development:</span> Analysis of modernization, democratization, political change, state-building, and nation-building processes</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Political Economy:</span> Study of the relationship between political and economic systems, development strategies, and distribution of resources</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Contemporary Issues:</span> Examination of globalization, migration, terrorism, environmental politics, and human rights</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The scope continues to expand with new challenges like digital governance, populism, and transnational political movements, making Comparative Politics a dynamic and evolving discipline.</p>

            <div id="q3" class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">3. Discuss the Main Features of the British Constitution <span class="marks">10 marks</span></h2>
                <div class="answer-section">
                    <p>The British Constitution is unique among major democracies due to its distinctive characteristics:</p>
                    
                    <h4>1. Unwritten/Uncodified Nature</h4>
                    <p>Unlike most constitutions, the British Constitution is not contained in a single written document. It consists of various sources including statutes, conventions, judicial decisions, and authoritative works. This makes it flexible but sometimes ambiguous.</p>
                    
                    <h4>2. Evolutionary Development</h4>
                    <p>The British Constitution has evolved gradually over centuries through historical developments like the Magna Carta (1215), Bill of Rights (1689), and various Acts of Parliament. It reflects Britain's continuous political tradition without revolutionary breaks.</p>
                    
                    <h4>3. Supremacy of Parliament</h4>
                    <p>Parliamentary sovereignty is the cornerstone principle. Parliament has supreme legislative authority and can make or unmake any law. No other body can override or set aside Parliamentary legislation, though EU membership (1973-2020) and devolution have created complexities.</p>
                    
                    <h4>4. Rule of Law</h4>
                    <p>Equality before law, absence of arbitrary power, and constitutional principles derived from judicial decisions ensure that government powers are legally constrained and individual rights are protected.</p>
                    
                    <h4>5. Constitutional Monarchy</h4>
                    <p>The Monarch is the ceremonial head of state with theoretical powers, but actual governance is conducted by elected representatives. The Monarch acts on the advice of ministers, exemplifying the principle "The King/Queen reigns but does not rule."</p>
                    
                    <h4>6. Unitary System with Devolution</h4>
                    <p>Traditionally a unitary state, Britain has undergone devolution, granting legislative powers to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland while retaining sovereignty at Westminster.</p>
                    
                    <h4>7. Fusion of Powers</h4>
                    <p>Unlike presidential systems with separation of powers, Britain has a fusion where the executive (Cabinet) emerges from and is responsible to the legislature (Parliament). The Prime Minister is both head of government and a member of Parliament.</p>
                    
                    <h4>8. Cabinet Government</h4>
                    <p>Collective responsibility ensures Cabinet unity in policy decisions. Ministers must publicly support Cabinet decisions or resign.</p>
                    
                    <h4>9. Conventions and Customs</h4>
                    <p>Unwritten conventions like ministerial responsibility, royal assent to bills, and the formation of government by the party with Parliamentary majority are crucial operational rules.</p>
                    
                    <h4>10. Flexibility</h4>
                    <p>Being uncodified allows easy adaptation to changing circumstances without formal amendment procedures, though this can also lead to uncertainty about constitutional boundaries.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>These features make the British Constitution a unique model of pragmatic, evolutionary constitutionalism.</strong></p>

                <div class="answer-section">
                    <h3>SOCIALISM</h3>
                    <p>Socialism emerged as a response to industrial capitalism's inequalities in the 19th century, advocating for collective ownership and egalitarian distribution.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Main Features:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Public/Collective Ownership:</span> Means of production, distribution, and exchange are owned by the state or community, not private individuals</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Economic Planning:</span> Central planning replaces market mechanisms to allocate resources and determine production priorities</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Elimination of Class Distinctions:</span> Aims to abolish class-based society and achieve social and economic equality</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Equitable Distribution:</span> Wealth and resources distributed based on need and contribution, not capital ownership ("From each according to ability, to each according to need")</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Social Welfare:</span> Emphasis on universal healthcare, education, housing, and employment as state responsibilities</li>

                    <h3>CAPITALISM</h3>
                    <p>Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership, market competition, and profit motive, dominant in Western economies.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Main Features:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Private Ownership:</span> Means of production owned by private individuals and corporations who control resources and derive profits</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Market Economy:</span> Free market mechanisms of supply and demand determine prices, production, and distribution</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Profit Motive:</span> Economic activity driven by pursuit of maximum profit and individual self-interest</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Competition:</span> Open competition among enterprises promotes efficiency, innovation, and consumer choice</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Limited Government Intervention:</span> Minimal state role in economy; government provides legal framework but doesn't control production</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Capital Accumulation:</span> Emphasis on investment, savings, and wealth creation through entrepreneurship</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Wage Labor:</span> Workers sell labor for wages while owners control means of production and profit</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Comparison</h3>
                    <p>While socialism prioritizes equality and collective welfare through state control, capitalism emphasizes individual freedom, private enterprise, and market efficiency. Modern economies often blend elements of both in mixed economic systems, with variations like social democracy, market socialism, and welfare capitalism representing different balancing points between these ideologies.</p>

                        <li>Former colonial powers maintain economic exploitation and political influence without formal sovereignty</li>
                        <li>Creates "flag independence" where countries are formally sovereign but economically dependent</li>

                        <li>Major wave occurred post-World War II (1945-1975) when colonial empires collapsed</li>
                        <li>Driven by nationalist movements, weakened colonial powers, Cold War dynamics, and changing international norms</li>
                        <li>Varied processes: peaceful negotiations (India), armed struggles (Algeria, Vietnam), and mixed approaches</li>
                        <li>Left legacies including artificial borders, weak institutions, ethnic conflicts, and economic dependencies</li>
                        <li>Incomplete in many respects due to neo-colonial relationships replacing formal colonialism</li>
                        <li>The UN played a role through anti-colonial resolutions and support for self-determination</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Interconnections</h3>
                    <p>These concepts form a continuum of domination: Imperialism as the ideology and policy, colonialism as its direct manifestation, decolonization as the formal end of colonial rule, and neo-colonialism as imperialism's contemporary form. Understanding these terms is crucial for analyzing global power structures and North-South relations.</p>

                    <h3>Critiques and Alternatives</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Postcolonial Critique</h4>
                    <p>Scholars like Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, and Frantz Fanon exposed how Eurocentrism served colonial domination and continues through neo-colonial relationships and knowledge production.</p>

                    <h4>Calls for Pluralism</h4>
                    <p>Advocates demand recognition of multiple modernities, diverse paths to development, and legitimacy of non-Western political systems and knowledge traditions.</p>

                    <h4>Decolonizing Knowledge</h4>
                    <p>Movements to center indigenous, African, Asian, and Latin American perspectives, theories, and methodologies in academic disciplines.</p>

                    <h3>Importance for Comparative Politics</h3>
                    <p>Recognizing Eurocentrism is crucial for genuinely comparative analysis that doesn't impose Western categories on non-Western contexts, acknowledges diverse political experiences as legitimate, and develops theories accounting for global diversity rather than universalizing particular experiences.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Overcoming Eurocentrism requires epistemic humility, recognition of multiple valid perspectives, and commitment to truly global, rather than Western-centric, comparative analysis.</strong></p>
