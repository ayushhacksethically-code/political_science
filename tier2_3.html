However, socialist ideas, critiques, and principles remain relevant and influential in various forms: social democratic welfare states, socialist elements within mixed economies, China's 'socialism with Chinese characteristics,' persistent critiques of capitalism's inequality and exploitation, and renewed interest in alternatives to neoliberalism. Therefore, while a particular historical form of socialism has ended, declaring socialism categorically 'dead' oversimplifies. Socialist thought continues evolving, adapting, and influencing political discourse and policy, making complete obituaries premature. The relevant question may not be whether socialism is dead, but what forms it takes in contemporary contexts and how it addresses 21st-century challenges."
